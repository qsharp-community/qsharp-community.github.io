ðŸŽ‰Hi from the Q# Community Admins!ðŸŽ‰

It has been a really exciting few years for the quantum computing community as well as for Q# as a language. We have seen some really [amazing new features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/qdk-relnotes), an active and open [language design process](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language), and the public (preview) launch of [Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/).

It also happens to be the community's ðŸŽˆsecond birthdayðŸŽˆ and it has been amazing to see what we have worked in together. We are also excited to share with you want is coming up and some new changes to our space!

- **We are moving to [Discord](https://discord.qsharp.community)**

  There are a lot of ways and tools to build a space where folks feel they can ask questions and interact with each other in a fun and safe manner. Discord is one of the leaders in this space and we feel that it will better meet the needs of the community here than our current slack. If you haven't used before, check out some [info about the platform](https://discord.com/why-discord-is-different) from Discord.

- **Community office hours**

  We will be hosting once a month on our discord community office hours where folks can ask questions, share what they are working on, or just general get to know others in the community. Especially with all the current remote work and conferences we are not getting the same opportunities to connect with other folks that we can learn from and work with. The first office hours will be [April 22 @ 10 AM PDT](https://www.starts-at.com/event/7995289407), make sure you join the discord and come say hi!

- **[Community road map](https://github.com/qsharp-community/roadmap) + volunteers**

  We are excited to share a road map for what we want this community to look like for the next 3-5 years so firstly, [check it out here](https://github.com/qsharp-community/roadmap)! The issues on the repo correspond to the high-level goals for this year, so if you have any feedback about the goals, ideas on how we can achieve them, or want to volunteer to make them happen; please leave us a comment or chat on Discord ðŸ’–
