Hi Everyone!

There has been a lot of exciting developments in the Q# community recently, from the announcement of [Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/), tons of new features and bug fixes in [QDK releases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/relnotes/), and a new way to run your Q# code as a [command line application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/standalone)!

We here at the community have been working hard to curate more community projects, posts, and Q# content, like our new [qRAM library](https://github.com/qsharp-community/qram) or [Q# live coding on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/crazy4pi314)!
We are super excited to highlight some of the amazing open source community projects and content that are making the Q# and quantum development community better.

If you would like to contribute a blog post, host your project as a part of the community, or have any ideas for a project you would like to see, either make a [pull request](https://github.com/qsharp-community/qsharp-community.github.io/pulls) or hop on the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qsharp-community/shared_invite/zt-fnsl4u42-u21wdJRzlLF9oAqYTDDtwA) and let us know!

> Never made a pull request before? Not sure how to use our website template? We can help! Just message us on the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qsharp-community/shared_invite/zt-fnsl4u42-u21wdJRzlLF9oAqYTDDtwA) or send an email to [info@qsharp.community](mailto:info@qsharp.community)ðŸ’–

Thanks, and we are excited to see how this community grows!
